Instead of copying the same entry several times, I'll continue following the latter version from my last entry and give my impressions of the class, as well as my progress on the assignments. 

There was a lot of learning yesterday, especially involving objects! It felt a bit hard to keep up, and I lost my place once we got to the renderStore method (if that's the right thing to call it), but it felt good to understand a good chunk. 

Creating storeObjects that automatically create other stores seems like a pretty key point to programming - automating procedures and making repetitive work easy. 

I also absolutely LOVED the fact that we're learning how to modify HTML through JavaScript. I'm very interested in learning how programming can make practical, live changes like this. I'm unsure if the coursework will teach how to build executable files, but I'd like to learn that as well!
