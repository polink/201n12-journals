My motivations for learning are financial. Ideally, to get that $100k/yr. But also I don't want to feel stagnant. I'd like to keep growing and learning. 

For this course, growing in programming is something I definitely feel ready for. After some jumps and starts at different points in my life since high school, I'm ready to take a nice stab at learning code. I also don't see this as a motivation that will go away. Being part of the Tech industry, it's important to keep your skills up to par to stay competitive, so I only see more learning in my future. 

There's also some broad future goals that also motivate me to learn. I've had a thought to go to grad school in user experience or interface design. It would also be cool to own my own game development studio in the next 10 years. I'm not entirely sure how I'll get there, but these goal posts will keep me moving in this direction.
