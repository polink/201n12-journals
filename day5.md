<p>My WHYS for learning are financial. Ideally, to get that $100k/yr. But also I don't want to feel stagnant. I'd like to keep growing and learning.</p>
<p>For this course, growing in programming is something I definitely feel ready for. After some jumps and starts at different points in my life since high school, I'm ready to take a nice stab at learning code. I also don't see this as a WHY that will go away. Being part of the Tech industry, it's important to keep your skills up to par to stay competitive, so I only see more learning in my future.</p>
<p>There's also some broad future goals that also give me reasons to learn. I've had a thought to go to grad school in user experience or interface design. It would also be cool to own my own game development studio in the next 10 years. I'm not entirely sure how I'll get there, but these goal posts will keep me moving in this direction.</p>

<p>You may notice that I changed a few words from my last journal. I'll still write more, so it doesn't serve as a cop-out. Though I'm unsure the clear difference between WHYs and motivation.</p>
<p>I'll at least cover my thoughts on recent classes and assignments. I do see the benefit to the repetition of much of the work that we do. I found the CSS Selector/Diner practice entertaining, though my attempts ended up with just using trial and error to find the right answer, rather then absorb what was being taught on the right of the page. Will likely have to look at again.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the future slightly, I started planning my "Talk to your Network" interview a PM at my work. I also plan to work on the reading a little bit today, and maybe get a start on one of the next assignments. More tomorrow!</p>
