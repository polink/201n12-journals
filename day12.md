I realize that we haven't had any journals due for the past couple classes!

Today, in class 12, we learned how to use chart.js. We didn't really cover canvas as much, but it sounds like an interesting tool to draw and make designs.

I like that we covered a lot of what we needed to get started with Lab12. I find that I learn code better by having related code to work off of.

Hopefully, I'll be able to have more inherent knowledge in the future, though even in those situations, I'm sure I'd be able to Google and access other code to reference.
