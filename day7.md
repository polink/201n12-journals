Using this submission for the 9/24 class.

The main issue I have with this lecture was not saying ahead of time that we shouldn't copy the PandaStores code verbatim. I understand that we should follow more the steps to do the DOM manipulation of HTML properly, in terms of the concept. Maybe I missed that, but it was jarring to hear that we shouldn't copy the code verbatim at the end of the class.

That being said, I do appreciate the frameworks being built for very difficult concepts.
