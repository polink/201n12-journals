today i did a cool thing and learned about loops more!
i'm hoping the third time's the charm, or at the least it'll be easier to subconsciously re-learn this information.
in the past, i've taken CSE142 at UW to attempt to start my CompSci efforts... about 14 years ago in 2004. programming was in a much
different place at the time, so we didn't have Github or sites developed to a good state like Khan Academy to teach us this information.
much of what we did seemed a lot clunkier.

this isn't to forget the HTML class I took in high school. realistically, it would've been good to continue those classes at that time,
but what's done is done.

i've also taken coursework through my Certificate in IT Foundations from the UW Professional & Continuing Education in 2015. there, I took
these classes at a basic level: SQL, Python, and C#.

hopefully, this intensive coursework with Code Fellows will help all this information stick!
